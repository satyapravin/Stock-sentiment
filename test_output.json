The index managed to sustain above the 20-day moving average (17,155) but has been forming narrow range Doji Candles suggesting indecision between the buyers and sellers.The RSI (relative strength index) is flat and has been hovering around the 50 mark.The index has made multiple price rejection at 17,600 (supply zone). On the downside 17,000 will acts as a strong psychological support.From the broader point of view, looking at the price action we expect the Nifty to consolidate between 17,000-17,600.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Close Related storiesMalay ThakkarTechnical Research Associate|GEPL Capital Deepak Nitrite: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,440.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,265 | Target: Rs 2,950 | Return: 20.88 percentOn the daily timeframe, Deepak Nitrite has given a breakout of a 2 months long Head and Shoulder bottom formation (Rs 2,400 neckline) with an increase in volume activity.Along with Rs 2,400 neckline breakout the prices have also broken above the 20-week SMA (Rs 2,370). Indicator on weekly is signaling a positive reversal (prices making Higher low but RSI making a lower low) indicating Bullish momentum to continue.Going ahead Rs 2,370-2,400 zone will act as a strong support for this counter. One can look forward to chart pattern target of Rs 2,800 followed by Rs 2,950 levels on the upside, keeping a stop loss of Rs 2,265 on daily closing basis.Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,437.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200 | Target: Rs 2,980 | Return: 22 percentTitan on mid-term charts is moving in a higher-highs and higher-lows formation, indicating that the mid-term trend of Titan remains strongly bullish.

The stock is in to the strong uptrend, in this month alone it rallied nearly 20 percent.The texture of the chart suggests, strong uptrend formation is likely to continue in the near future.For the trend following traders, now Rs 4,600 or 9-day SMA (simple moving average) would be the sacrosanct support level. Above the same, the breakout continuation formation will continue till Rs 4,900-5,100. On the flip side, below Rs 4,600 uptrend would be vulnerable.Graphite IndiaAfter a medium term price correction, finally the stock took the support near Rs 400. Post correction, it has formed double bottom formation and reversed sharply. On Thursday, despite tepid market conditions the stock rallied 20 percent.A strong price volume rally clearly supports further uptrend. For the swing traders, Rs 490 and Rs 485 would be the trend decider level.Trading above the same levels, the positive momentum will continue up to Rs 550-585. However, if it closes below Rs 485, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions.Responsive IndustriesAfter a medium term price correction, the stock has formed higher bottom formation near Rs 100. Post formation, the stock reversed sharply and successfully clear the short term resistance of Rs 125.After a long time Responsive Industries is trading above 200-day SMA which is broadly positive. On Thursday, it rallied 20 percent, strong price volume rally indicating further uptrend from current levels.For the positional traders, now 200-day SMA or Rs 135 could be the key level to watch out. If the stock manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 160-170.On the flip side, if the stock closes below Rs 135, it may trigger further weakness up to Rs 114-110 support level.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Its product portfolio includes emulsions, enamels, wood coatings, distempers, primers, putties, and cement paint. Despite being a late entrant to this industry with high entry barriers, INDIGOPN has been able to create its presence in the market through its multi-pronged strategy of introducing differentiated products, high ad spends (as a percentage of sales), focusing on the rural markets, and increasing the penetration of tinting machines. The company has a presence in 27 States and 7 Union Territories with its distribution network of more than 14,700 dealers.OutlookWe expect INDIGOPN to continue with its robust strategy and thereby deliver a sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of ~28%/35%/41% over FY21\u201324E. The recent sharp price hikes across the industry would further support sales growth and margin recovery in 2HFY22/FY23E. We initiate coverage with a Buy rating, with TP of INR2,270 (55x FY24E EPS).More\u00a0Info on TrentClose  Related stories Buy Persistent Systems: target of Rs 5550: SharekhanIndigo Paints share price surges 12% as Motilal Oswal gives a 'buy' rating At 11:10 hrs Indigo Paints was quoting at Rs 2,176.85, up Rs 234.45, or 12.07 percent.It was trading with volumes of 9,068 shares, compared to its thirty day average of 2,435 shares, an increase of 272.43 percent.In the previous trading session, the share closed down 1.42 percent or Rs 27.95 at Rs 1,942.40.The share touched its 52-week high Rs 3,348.00 and 52-week low Rs 1,490.00 on 03 February, 2021 and 29 January, 2021, respectively.Currently, it is trading 34.98 percent below its 52-week high and 46.1 percent above its 52-week low.Market capitalisation stands at Rs 10,355.06 crore.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The stock was the top Sensex gainer trading at Rs 2,523.45, up Rs 86.80 or 3.56 percent at 10:29 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,531.55 and an intraday low of Rs 2,440.It was trading with volumes of 35,391 shares, compared to its five-day average of 27,983 shares, an increase of 26.48 percent.Domestic research and broking firm Motilal Oswal has retained a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 2,830 per share, an upside of 12 percent from the current market price.According to the research firm, the margin recovery in jewellery was heartening and surpassed expectation, inspiring further confidence in Titan's earnings growth in addition to the already healthy sales outlook. It has raised its FY22/FY23 EPS (earnings per share) estimates by 13%/3%.\"Titan Company has a strong growth runway, given its market share of less than 10% and the continuing struggles faced by its unorganised and organised peers. Its medium to long-term earnings growth opportunity is the best-of-breed, which is reflected in its EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% over the past three years before the Covid impact in FY21. The estimated EPS CAGR over FY20-FY24 is also healthy at 24%,\" it said.Close  Related stories Responsive Industries gains 72% in three sessions; possible uptrend seen by brokerageIndigo Paints share price surges 12% as Motilal Oswal gives a 'buy' rating \"At its current valuation of 79.3x FY23E EPS, the stock\u2019s near-term multiples appear expensive, although its long runway for profitable growth warrants premium multiples.

The fall in the share price came after\u00a0Reliance Jio Infocomm, the\u00a0telecom unit, saw a reduction in subscribers and a delay in the launch of JioPhone, a low-cost smartphone. Analysts said the launch of JioPhone Next is unlikely to increase subscribers.\u201cThe new smartphone JioPhone Next plans are less aggressive than we expected,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. \u201cWhile the subscriber market share increase could be more measured, considering the handset price point, subscriber churns could be lower as well.\u201dThe re-evaluation of a\u00a0proposed investment in Reliance\u2019s oil-to-chemicals business by Saudi Aramco and Reliance\u00a0was a sentiment dampener.Close  Related stories In charts | How BSE sectoral indices fared in past decadeIDFC jumps 9% after IDFC First Bank favours 3-way mergerReliance up after subsidiary signs pact to buy 100% of UK\u2019s Faradion \u201cNon-consumption of deals is negative; but we don\u2019t rule out more broad-based partnership in future. Recent stock price correction offers an attractive entry point; we expect multiple value unlocking opportunities at play,\u201d Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note to investors.Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded the Reliance stock to \u2018buy\u2019 from \u2018add\u2019 after noting a favourable reward-risk balance following the decline in the shares and the relative sharp underperformance compared with peers in the telecom and retail businesses.It expects Reliance\u2019s\u00a0earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda)\u00a0to grow at a compound annual rate of 26 percent over the next two years, driven by strength in refining and polyester margins, higher telecom tariffs, robust growth in retailing, and an increase in contributions from the oil exploration and production segment.It said the stock is set for a re-rating, led by the scaling up of its new commerce and energy ventures. Kotak said the stage is set for further increases in telecom tariffs in the coming years following the recent policy decision to defer adjusted gross revenue and spectrum liabilities payable by telecom companies by four years.Kotak raised the FY22-24 Ebitda estimates for Jio by 8-23 percent and by 2-10 percent for Reliance (consolidated), factoring in higher average revenue per user along with a modestly lower subscriber base and other minor changes.Analysts said the 5G spectrum auction and pricing, expected next year, progress in the new energy business with large acquisitions and stake sales to outside investors, and the listing of Jio and retail entities would be the new triggers for the Reliance stock.A delay in the launch of Jio Payment Bank and the Reliance-Future deal court cases with Amazon are likely to be the main concerns for investors\u201cWe do not see Jio/Retail being listed for the next 18 months at least; stake sales of any other businesses (e-commerce/smaller stake sale in O2C) would be positive. We highlight that e-commerce across segments for Reliance is growing strongly,\u201d JPMorgan said in a note to investors.Chairman Mukesh Ambani said recently that Reliance will become one of the strongest and most reputed Indian multinational firms in the world in the coming years, propelled by its entry into the clean and green energy sector as well as retail and telecom operations reaching unprecedented heights. Ambani also said it is in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition.Disclaimer:\u00a0Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

PSL targets to achieve $1 billion revenue run-rate in the next 6-8 quarters, implying a CQGR of 4.6% to 6.5%, driven by strong demand, healthy deal intake, strong execution, and M&A activities. EBITDA margin to decline by 60 bps q-o-q to 16% in Q3FY2022, owing to higher ESOP expenses.

It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,187.70 and an intraday low of Rs 1,980.05.The scrip was trading with volumes of 2,951 shares compared to its five-day average of 1,032 shares, an increase of 185.89 percent.According to the domestic research and broking firm, the Indian paints industry is an oligopolistic industry dominated so far by four large players. The industry has high entry barriers for newcomers as the incumbents have strong moats such as robust distribution networks, strong brand equity, and significant penetration of tinting machines. Indigo Paints is the only new entrant in the last two decades to have successfully overcome these high barriers with its patient and multi-pronged strategy, which comprises of introducing differentiated products to distinguish itself in the market.It focuses on niche and differentiated products (~30% of sales in FY21, with the first-mover advantage in many cases), which helps it to distinguish itself in a competitive market and get access to dealer shelf space. These products are also margin accretive, it said.Close  Related stories Responsive Industries gains 72% in three sessions; possible uptrend seen by brokerageBuy Indigo Paints; target of Rs 2270: Motilal OswalTitan Company outshines index gainers, jumps 3%; brokerages expect 18% upside Catch all the market action on our\u00a0live blogRobust industry growth prospectsThe Rs 545 billion (USD7.2 billion) paints industry in India is expected to post a 12.2% CAGR over FY19\u201324E, led by a ~10% volume CAGR. With the recent sharp price hikes, industry sales are expected to grow further in the coming years. Decorative paints (74% of the Indian Paints market) is expected to grow at a faster pace (~13% CAGR), from Rs 403 billion (USD 5.4 billion) in FY19. India has one of the lowest per capita consumption numbers, even compared with emerging markets offering long growth runways, the brokerage firm said.Industry growth drivers comprise urbanization, the shortening of the repainting cycle, growth in branded players, and the robust pricing power of the branded players. Additionally, the oligopolistic nature of the industry means that the incumbents would see considerable growth opportunity, Motilal Oswal added.Company slated to deliver strong growthOver FY18\u201321, Indigo Paints delivered a sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of ~22%/68%/70%, driven by its efforts on distribution expansion, the proliferation of tinting machines, brand investments, and an improving product mix through differentiated products. We expect these initiatives to continue in the coming years as well. In addition, the company has taken 18\u201320% price hikes in recent months (in line with that of the industry) amid sharp commodity inflation.Accordingly, the brokerage firm expects it to deliver a sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of ~28%/ 35%/41% over FY21\u201324E.It further expects it to continue to do so in the coming years as well.Valuation and view\"While we expect Indigo Paints to continue to outperform larger peers in the industry, aggression by larger players in the rural markets could put the brakes on the company's growth aspirations. At the same time, greater acceptability in the urban markets would be crucial to Indigo's ambitions of achieving scale. Therefore, it would be necessary to watch out for the company's performance in both these markets,\" the research firm said in its report.\"On account of its strong topline and earnings growth outlook, we believe Indigo Paints deserves higher multiples in line with large peers trading at 55\u201360x. We initiate coverage with a buy rating, and targetr of Rs 2,270 (55x FY24E EPS),\" it added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The stock has been in focus after the bank wrote-off loans worth Rs 300 crore within seven months of the loans being sanctioned.At 10:59 hours, the stock was trading at Rs 132.75, down Rs 11.55, or 8.00 percent. It touched a 52-week low of Rs 130.50.The key reason for Reserve Bank of India's sudden intervention in private lender RBL Bank was a Rs 300-crore loan that was written off within seven months of being sanctioned, according to a report by newspaper publication Mint.In other news, RBL Bank on December 30 informed that the RBI has approved the appointment of Rajeev Ahuja as Interim Managing Director\u00a0and CEO of the bank for a period of three months with effect from December 25, 2021 or till the appointment of a regular MD\u00a0and CEO, whichever is earlier.Also Read:\u00a0RBI says RBL Bank well capitalised, financial position satisfactoryClose  Related stories Responsive Industries gains 72% in three sessions; possible uptrend seen by brokerageTitan Company outshines index gainers, jumps 3%; brokerages expect 18% upsideIndigo Paints share price surges 12% as Motilal Oswal gives a 'buy' rating RBL Bank\u2019s financial health is stable and it is well-capitalised, the RBI said on December 27, two days after its sudden move to name Yogesh Dayal as an additional director triggered concerns about private lender\u2019s stability.The stock price has been on additional pressure after report by Edelweiss Securities said that the private sector lender may get excluded from the Nifty Bank index in the National Stock Exchange's upcoming review due in March 2022.\"The index change is expected to take place after the recent developments at the bank,\" Edelweiss said.Domestic research and broking firm Motilal Oswal in its report said that the current developments have raised concerns about the bank\u2019s ability to sustain a turnaround in its operating performance, while at the same time raising worries of similar actions by the regulator on other mid-sized banks, where the operating performance has been sub-optimal.We thus put our rating under review and remain watchful of further developments and await further clarity in the 3QFY22 result.Meanwhile, foreign brokerage CLSA said the next\u00a06 months will be key in validating the management\u2019s reiteration of its performance. It has\u00a0maintained an \"outperform\" rating and cut target to Rs 200 from Rs 230 per share.Catch all the market action on our\u00a0live blogICICI Securities has downgraded the stock to \"sell\", and lowered its target price to Rs 131 from Rs 181\u00a0on the back of looming uncertainty. This interim adverse development can drag valuation to as low as 0.55x FY23 book, the brokerage said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

However, the performance this year is not impressive as the stock is down nearly 4%.\u201cAfter a medium-term price correction, the stock formed higher bottom formation near Rs 100. Following formation, the stock reversed sharply and successfully cleared the short-term resistance of Rs 125. After a long time, Responsive is trading above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) which is broadly positive,\u201d said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities.\u00a0Yesterday the stock rallied 20 percent. \u201cFor the positional traders, now the 200-day SMA or Rs 135 could be the key level to watch out. If the stock manages to trade above that then we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 160-170. But if the stock closes below Rs 135 it may trigger further weakness up to Rs 114-110 support level,\u201d he added.Close  Related stories Titan Company outshines index gainers, jumps 3%; brokerages expect 18% upsideIndigo Paints share price surges 12% as Motilal Oswal gives a 'buy' rating Yesterday, the firm also reported its September quarter earnings: Consolidated net profit stood at Rs 6.42 crore against a loss of Rs 2.70 crore a quarter ago. Revenue was Rs 292.92 crore, up 66% from last quarter.On Monday, Responsive told exchanges its board had approved a revised scheme of amalgamation of Axiom Cordages with itself.\u201cUpon amalgamation, shares held by the company in Axiom and vice versa shall stand cancelled, and the share capital of the company shall be reduced to that extent,\u201d the firm said.Responsive added it will allot 100 shares for every 81 shares held by others in Axiom.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

However, rise in COVID-19 cases might put a pause to strong recovery in the retail space. Trent registered revenue growth of 25% in Q2FY2022 over Q2FY2020. With strong footfalls during the festive season, we expect revenue to grow by 30% in Q3FY2022 over Q3FY2020. Sustained store additions (added 31 stores in H1), increasing focus on digital sales, and expanding the differentiated portfolio would help the company to stay ahead of competition in the branded apparel space.OutlookWe reiterate Buy on Trent with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,275. Differentiated business model, strong store expansion plan, and healthy balance sheet (with cash of over Rs. 500cr) makes it a good pick in the retail space.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereClose  Related stories Buy Persistent Systems: target of Rs 5550: SharekhanBuy Indigo Paints; target of Rs 2270: Motilal OswalBuy USDINR; target of : 74.90 : ICICI Direct Disclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
